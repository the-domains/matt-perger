I am a partner at [St Ali][0] and [Sensory Lab][1] Australia.

I send out a weekly email to ~11,000 people called [Barista Hustle][2]. It's free, advanced and relevant to Baristas anywhere.

My website [Coffee Hustle][3] is a place for coffee professionals to share and discuss anything. This community also has a Slack chat group with more than 600 active members. Join us!

Find me on [Twitter][4], [Facebook,][5] and [Instagram][6].

I've recently started my own company, Proper Ventures, in partnership with Sensory Lab. Its purpose is to push the boundaries of coffee further by any means necessary. Stay tuned.
