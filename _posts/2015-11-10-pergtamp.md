For the last year, I have been working closely with Pullman Tampers to create a tamper for use with the EK43\. This initially simple project has since evolved into a completely new tamper design - for use with any grinder - that markedly improves extraction, consistency, ergonomics, cleanliness and taste.

**Diameter**

A tamper's diameter is very important, but it's only one part of the story. Along with diameter, one should be measuring the effective tamping area. That is, the size of the area that's actually compressing the coffee grounds. At first this seems quite simple, but almost all tamper manufacturers include a curved edge or 'fillet' on the bottom of their tampers. This feature reduces their effective tamping area by a startling amount. These diagrams will help you to understand how a tiny curve can have a big impact on your tamper's effectiveness. Keep in mind that all of them are to scale, and assume that all VST baskets have an internal diameter of 58.7mm.
